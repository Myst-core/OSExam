    What you can do to reduce your Carbon Footprint
{% endblock heading %}

    <p class="description">A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), that are released into the atmosphere because of your activities. 
        These gases trap heat and contribute to climate change. 
        Your carbon footprint includes things like the fuel burned by your car, the electricity you use, the food you eat, 
        and even the products you buyâ€”because making and transporting them also creates emissions.</p>

            <h2 class="white">1. Choose local food to eat</h2>
            <p>Fossil fuels are used in vehicles to tranport your food. When fossil fuels burn, 
                they release CO<sub>2</sub> into the air. If you buy local, the food spends less time in a vehicle, 
                meaning less CO<sub>2</sub> into the air!</p>

            <h2 class="white">2. Don't buy fast fashion</h2>
            <p>Cheap clothes that go out of fashion quickly, end up in landfills, and over time, produce methane as they decompose.
                Methane is a greenhouse gas, which stops heat from leaving the atmosphere and therefore heating the planet up!

            <h2 class="white">3. Drive less and walk more</h2>
            <p>As you drive, your vehicle's engine releases CO<sub>2</sub> into the air. 
                Take public transport, ride a bike or walk to your destination.
                This will reduce the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> getting into the air as there are less vehicles on the road.</p>

            <h2 class="white">4. Recycle</h2>
            <p>Handling waste can be a carbon-intensive process. 
                Recycling reduces the waste going to landfills and gives plastics made from fossil fuels a second life.</p>

            <p>Many people waste energy by leaving unused lights on for hours. 
                Another common energy-wasting habit is leaving appliances plugged in when not in use. 
                Modern appliances in stand-by mode draw small amounts of power all the time. 
                When you unplug appliances, you can save energy.</p>
