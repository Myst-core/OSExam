        <p class="description">
            Solar panels are devices that capture sunlight and turn it into electricity. 
            They are made up of special cells that absorb sunlight and 
            convert it into usable power for your home. 
            This means you can generate your own clean energy, 
            reducing electricity bills and helping the environment by using renewable energy 
            instead of fossil fuels!
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if type == "EV Chargers" %}
        <p class="description">
            EV chargers are devices that charge electric vehicles (EVs)
            by supplying them with electricity. 
            They plug into your car and refill the battery, 
            just like a fuel pump does for gas-powered cars. 
            With an EV charger at home, you can charge your vehicle conveniently, 
            reduce running costs, and support a cleaner environment by using electricity 
            instead of petrol or diesel!
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if type == "Home EMS's" %}
        <p class="description">
            Home Energy Management Systems (EMS) are smart devices that help you monitor and 
            control your home's energy use. They connect to appliances, solar panels, and EV chargers, 
            giving you real-time data on electricity consumption. 
            With an EMS, you can optimize energy use, save money on bills, 
            and reduce waste, making your home more efficient and environmentally friendly!
